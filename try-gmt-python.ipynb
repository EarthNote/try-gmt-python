This is a Markdown cell (click on it to see the source) and it can contain text, hyperlinks, images, and even Latex equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute any cell, click on it and type `Shift + Enter` or click on the \"Run\" button in the menu bar. Executing a Markdown cell will render its content. Code execution can happen non-linearly, so you can change and rerun a cell without running all of the ones that came before it. But you'll still need to run cells that define a variable/import a module before you can use the variable/module in another cell. You can restart and clear the notebook at any time in the \"Kernel\" menu.\n",

    "2. The arguments don't use the GMT 1-letter syntax (R, J, B, etc). Those are still available as aliases and the methods will accept them (see below). \n",
    "3. Arguments like `region` can take lists instead of strings like `1/2/3/4`. You can still use the string form but the list form is easier in Python.\n",
    "4. If a GMT argument has no options (like `-B` instead of `-Baf`), use a `True` value instead. An empty string would also be acceptable.\n",
